# .github/CODEOWNERS

# This is a basic example of a CODEOWNERS file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.

# Specify the default code owners for the entire repository.
*       @default-owner

# Define code owners for specific files or directories.
# These owners will be automatically requested for review when changes are made to these files or directories.

# Code owners for all Markdown files
*.md    @markdown-owner

# Code owners for specific directories
/docs/  @docs-owner
/src/   @src-owner
/tests/ @test-owner

# Code owners for specific files
/config.yml @config-owner
/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/* @issue-template-owner

# You can specify multiple owners for the same files or directories
# Use spaces to separate multiple owners
/important-directory/ @owner1 @owner2

# Code owners for a subdirectory within a directory
/src/components/ @components-owner

# Code owners for a specific file in a subdirectory
/src/components/Button.js @button-owner

# Team assignments (assuming the teams exist in your GitHub organization)
/frontend/* @org/frontend-team
/backend/*  @org/backend-team

# Wildcards can be used to specify patterns
# For example, all JavaScript files in the repo
*.js @js-owner

# If you want to assign code owners based on the branch
# You can use this format
# branch-name pattern @owner
